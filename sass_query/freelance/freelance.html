		<h2>A Few Resources For Freelance</h2>
		<p>For those of you that are considering going into freelancing, here are some resources you may find useful. I will go more into extra resources when we get closer to the end of the semester.</p>
			<img class="left-circle" src="../images/GAGlogo.png" alt="Graphic Artists Guild Logo">
		<h3>Graphic Artists Guild</h3>
		<p>The Graphics Artists Guild (GAG) enables graphic artists and other design professionals to build and maintain successful careers by providing skills and supportâ€”from advice on the daily tasks of running a creative business to going to bat for our creative community with business and government leaders. By joining the guild, you gain access to contacts that can both lead to jobs and lead to other artists that can help you on projects. They will also help you with any legal issues you face in the line of duty. GAG also offers free resources too which are listed on their Tools &amp; Resources page. These resources include explaining copyright, trademarks, and codes of fair practice. It also explains how to put together a contract, proposals, and a letter of agreement for jobs.</p>
		<p>Graphic Artists Guild Handbook: Pricing &amp; Ethical Guidelines is a book they put out every year. If you don't want to pay the dues to become a member, this book can be an invaluable resource. It helps you figure out how to run your own business (because that's what freelancing is, running your own business) by showing you how to charge and collect a payment, by showing how to protect yourself, how to document your work, etc.</p>
		<p>To explore their resources, you can click the Resources tab on the <a href="https://graphicartistsguild.org/webinars" target="_blank">Graphic Artist Guild Websites for Webinars <i class="fa-solid fa-right-to-bracket"></i></a> or <a href="https://graphicartistsguild.org/higher-education/" target="_blank">Graphic Art Guild Website for Education <i class="fa-solid fa-right-to-bracket"></i></a>.</p>

		<h3>American Institute of Graphic Arts</h3>
		<p>The American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) is much larger and older than GAG but they offer similar services. They advocate for designers, help connect you with clients, provide training opportunities, help promote you, and even provide insurance for you. Like GAG though, they also offer a ton of free resources found on their <a href="https://www.aiga.org/resources" target="_blank">Resources page <i class="fa-solid fa-right-to-bracket"></i></a>. These resources include things like ethical guidelines, career guides, case studies, etc. They even have a section dedicated to students on their <a href="https://www.aiga.org/resources/student-resources" target="_blank">Student Resources page <i class="fa-solid fa-right-to-bracket"></i></a>.</p>
		<h4>Design Business and Ethics</h4>
		<p>This documentation offers practical and specific directions for approaching design issues. It will help you protect yourself in the field and help you avoid making serious mistakes. I highly recommend that you review the document. It goes over how to put together a design brief, how to budget and manage a project, standards of practice, etc. Trust me, you don't know what you don't know.</p>
		<h4>AIGA Standard Form of Agreement for Design Services</h4>
		<p>This page goes over your client's responsibilities, your responsibilities, the fees, authorship, and publicity related to projects. Give the AIGA Standard Form Agreement page a read.</p>
		<p>Both the Design Business and Ethics and the AIGA Standard Form of Agreement for Design Services documents can be found on the <a href="https://www.aiga.org/resources/business-freelance-resources" target="_blank">Business Freelance Resources <i class="fa-solid fa-right-to-bracket"></i></a> page.</p>
		<p>To explore everything AIGA has to offer, go to <a href="https://www.aiga.org/" target="_blank">AIGA's website <i class="fa-solid fa-right-to-bracket"></i></a>.</p>
