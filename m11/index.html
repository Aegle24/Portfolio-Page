                <p>There was quite a lot to fix in my website. Mainly minifying css and dealing with images.</p>
                <p>I solved those two big problems easily by; using Prepos to minify my css and then saving my images as Webp's instead of PNGs.</p>

                <h2>Other Issues encountered</h2>
            <p>
                Accessibility is now an obvious issue for me to think about as, with almost every page, I have had to add something or change a color or two to ensure high accessibility on each page.

                <h2>A major Poblem</h2>
            <p>
                The most difficult problem I had to work on was preloading the Javascript. Even through all of the tutorials, I could not get it to work properly before needing to turn in the project.

            <p>
                This is the first page where I am standardizing my elements with a stylesheet that uses CSS variables and will become more of a blue print from now on.
